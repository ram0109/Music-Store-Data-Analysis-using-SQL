Leveraged aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and MAX() to analyze customer spending, identify top-selling genres by country, and track invoice trends, providing data-driven recommendations for marketing strategies.

Conducted advanced SQL operations to rank customers based on spending per country, using window functions such as ROW_NUMBER() for efficient customer segmentation.

Analyzed geographical sales trends by grouping invoice data by city and country, which helped identify target locations for promotional events and strategic expansion.
Ensured data accuracy and efficiency by structuring queries that minimized redundancy and optimized performance for large datasets.
